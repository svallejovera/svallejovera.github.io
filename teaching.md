## PS9594A: Computational Text Analysis
One of the most abundant sources of data available to social and political scientists today is text. Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have spearheaded a text-as-data revolution, which has led social scientists to seek out new means of analyzing text data at scale. In this course, we will the learn intuition behind--and how to implement--different computational methods to process, analyze, and classify text. The course will cover Bag-of-Words (BoW) approaches, unsupervised methods, supervised and semi-supervised methods, and generative methods that use text as data, as well as how we can interpret the results obtained from applying these methods.
