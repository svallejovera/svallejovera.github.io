Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Government at the Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, México. I am also the director of the interdisciplinary Laboratory of Computational Social Science - México ([iLCSS](https://ilcss.umd.edu/)). Previously, I was a Post-Doctoral Fellow at Department of Political Science at the University of Houston. I earned my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Maryland, College Park. 

My research explores the relation between gendered political institutions and representation, and racial identity and racism in Latin America. I am particularly interested in the gendered barriers in political institutions, and the strategic reaction of political actors when encountering these barriers. My methodological work applies novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) to a wide variety of text data, from legislative speeches to tweets, to answer substantive questions about gender, racism, and politics.
